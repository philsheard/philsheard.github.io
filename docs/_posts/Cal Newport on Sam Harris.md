# Cal Newport on Sam Harris

36-40 - good characterisation of knowledge work, via industrial revolution and IT in the 90s
42 - power of stress and burnout
58.30 - administrative overhead from many tasks
1.00.00 - 1.00.30 - it's not accomplish fewer things it's work on fewer things at the same time
1.02.30 - 1.03.00 - more time, not unlimited time. Still in a world of making commitments
1.07.00 - Sam's question about the rise of AI and abundance / end of scarcity / leisure
