# Cal Newport on Sam Harris

36-40 - good characterisation of knowledge work, via industrial revolution and IT in the 90s
42 - power of stress and burnout
58.30 - administrative overhead from many tasks
1.00.00 - 1.00.30 - it's not accomplish fewer things it's work on fewer things at the same time
1.02.30 - 1.03.00 - more time, not unlimited time. Still in a world of making commitments
1.07.00 - Sam's question about the rise of AI and abundance / end of scarcity / leisure
1.10.30 - humans love to see their intentions made manifest concretely in the world...we get bored and that negative physiological state is alleviated through the creation of newness...this is valuable, people respect this #important #quote
1.15.45 - administrative overload can lead to fatigue and a feeling the work isn't enjoyable, despite it being on the surface good work. "Self deterministic theory"
1.20.25 - end of long question / monologue by Sam about how his work and passions overlap massively, but he senses in culture that people aren't prepared for mass leisure and freedom
1.22.00 - against anti-work - we want to work
1.25.00 - "we want to do something that's appreciated" - sam
