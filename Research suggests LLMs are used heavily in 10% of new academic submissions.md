# Research suggests LLMs are used heavily in 10% of new academic submissions

The researchers analysed over a decade of academic research abstracts and looked for words that had risen significantly since the widespread usage of LLMs in 2022 when ChatGPT launched.

The words include "delve", "showcase" and "potential". Importantly these aren't new words to the language, but they were not so popular in academic research before widespread adoption of LLMs so the increase stands out.

What might this mean? Ironically, we all will have to work harder to a avoid these cliches and words so that our readers don't switch off and ignore our work as part of the AI generated soup. This is a good example of what Roger Martin has written about, [where (unskilled) use of LLMs by definition leads to average results]().

Some of the discussion around this article on Hacker News is around how LLMs are trained on public content that will disproportionately feature marketing materials. Whether or not you ask for 'marketing style' writing when using an LLM to autogenerate text, you might be getting it anyway due to the natural bias of the training data.
