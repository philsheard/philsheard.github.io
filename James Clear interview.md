# James Clear interview

"You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems"

Your goal is your desired outcome, the thing you want to achieve. Your system is the collection of daily habits you follow. If there's ever a gap between your system and your goal, your daily habits will always win. (27.50)

Goals good for:
- direction (personal or company)
- filtering - making choices
